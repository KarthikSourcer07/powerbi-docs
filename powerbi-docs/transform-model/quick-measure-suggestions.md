# Quick measure suggestions

Quick measure suggestions to assist creation of DAX formulas for [model measures](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tutorial-create-measures) using natural language instead of using templates or writing DAX from scratch is available in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view) using [Microsoft Fabric Copilot to write and explain DAX queries](/dax/dax-copilot). In a DAX query you can create query-scoped measures that can be added to your model. 

[Quick measures](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-quick-measures) is another feature that can help you create DAX measures using a template approach for commonly used measures, such as month-over-month change. [Visual calculations](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview) offers another alternative that can create a DAX calculation such as running totals directly in a visual. 

Power BI Desktop versions prior to October 2024 may still show the **Suggestions with Copilot** option but it will be disabled.
