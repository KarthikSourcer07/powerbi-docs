With Data Activator, you can set data alerts on the reports that you're interested in following. Read more about it in [What is Data Activator?](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/data-activator-introduction)

## Prerequisites

- You need to have write permission for a workspace with a Fabric capacity license.

You can sign up for a [Microsoft Fabric free trial](https://aka.ms/try-fabric).

## Set a data alert

1. From the visual context menu or report toolbar, tap a visual in the report, and then select  **Set alert**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-set-alerts/set-alert-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Set alert button in the Power BI ribbon." lightbox="media/business-user-set-alerts/set-alert-button.png":::

    A pane opens where you can set the measure you want to monitor in that visual, and the conditions you want to detect.

1. In the **Set an alert** pane, choose:

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-set-alerts/set-alert-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Set alert pane." lightbox="media/business-user-set-alerts/set-alert-pane.png":::

    - A measure to monitor.
    - A condition to evaluate.
    - A threshold to pass.

1. Decide whether to be notified by email or in Teams.
1. Save the alert to a workspace with a Fabric capacity license.
1. Select **Start my alert**, then select **Create alert**.

Power BI creates a Data Activator reflex and connects it to the data in your Power BI semantic model. Data Activator automatically starts monitoring your data and notifies you when the condition is met.

## Customize the trigger

You can further customize the trigger to:

- Watch for more complex conditions
- Notify different users
- Even launch a Power Automate workflow.

For more information, read the [Data Activator](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/data-activator-introduction) documentation.
