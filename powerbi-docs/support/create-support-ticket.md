Before creating a support ticket, get real-time help by using the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support) (admin roles only) or the [Microsoft Fabric support](https://support.fabric.microsoft.com/support) page. If you can't resolve the issue through self-help, create a support ticket.

## Steps for creating a support ticket
