# Limitations of Power BI Q&A

The [Q&A feature](/consumer/end-user-q-and-a.md) allows users to explore data from their Power BI semantic model using natural language to receive answers in the form of charts and graphs. Q&A is not available for [Power BI Report Server](/report-server/install-powerbi-desktop.md).  

## Data sources

### Supported data sources

Power BI Q&A supports the following configurations of data sources in the Power BI service:

- Import mode
- Live connect to Azure Analysis Services
- Live connect to on-premise SQL Server Analysis Services tabular models
- DirectLake models

In each of these configurations, row-level security is also supported. Object-level security is supported for models hosted in the Power BI service but not for live connect to Azure Analysis Services or on-premise SQL Server Analysis Services models.

#### DirectQuery support for Q&A

Q&A now supports SQL DirectQuery sources with APPROXIMATEDISTINCOUNT, including SQL Server 2019, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics. You can use Q&A to ask natural-language questions against these data sources. 

There's one change to the behavior of Q&A when it's in DirectQuery mode: After you enter your question, select **Submit**. This change prevents overloading the DirectQuery source with unnecessary queries as you type.

#### Composite model support

Q&A also supports composite models, if the model contains at least one of the following data sources:

- One import data source
- One supported DirectQuery data source

If the model contains a mix of data sources, we only index columns from import tables or columns from supported Direct Query sources. Thus, you can only ask questions about the instance values for columns from these data sources. You still can ask questions about the columns themselves. 

### Q&A Setup limitations 

The Q&A setup feature is only available from Power BI Desktop. Q&A setup supports the following data sources: 

- Import mode  
- Direct Query   
- DirectLake - coming soon 

### Data sources not supported

Power BI Q&A doesn't support the following configurations:

- Object level security with any type of data source
- Reporting Services 

## Tooling limitations

The new tooling dialog allows users to customize and improve the natural language in Q&A. To learn more about tooling, see [Intro to Q&A tooling](q-and-a-tooling-intro.md).

## Review question limitations

The review questions only store questions asked about your data model for up to 28 days. Power BI administrators can use the tenant settings to manage the ability to store questions. Permissions are based on security groups. 

Users can also keep their questions from being recorded by selecting **Settings** > **General** and setting the **Q&A option** to Off.

## Teach Q&A limitations

Teach Q&A allows you to fix two types of errors:

- Assign a word to a field.
- Assign a word a filter condition.

Currently, redefining a recognized term or defining other types of conditions or phrases isn't supported. Also, when defining filtering conditions, you can only use a limited subset of language, including:

- Product category with is accessories
- Product category with is not accessories
- Products > 100
- Products greater than 100
- Products = 100
- Products is 100
- Products < 100

Currently, redefining a recognized term or defining other types of conditions or phrases isn't supported.

### Statements not supported

- Multiple conditions aren't supported. As a workaround, create a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) calculated column that evaluates a multi-condition statement Boolean and use this field instead.
- If you don't specify a filter condition when Q&A prompts for a subset of data, you can't save the definition, even if the entire statement has no red underlines.
