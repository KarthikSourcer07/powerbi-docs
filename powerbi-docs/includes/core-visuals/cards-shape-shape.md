##### Shape

This menu provides a selection of geometric shapes:
- **Rectangle:** The standard shape option, rendering a four-sided polygon with right-angled corners.
- **Rounded Rectangle:** A variation of the rectangle, this shape features corners that are smoothly curved.
- **Snipped tab, both top:** A unique design where the top two corners of the rectangle are diagonally cut off.
