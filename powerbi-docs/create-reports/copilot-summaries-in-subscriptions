# Create reports in the Power BI service with Copilot

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You can include a Copilot generated summary for your Power BI report page or full report attachment in your email subscription to get insights. All the recipients of the email subscription will receive the copilot summary in the email. This feature is currently supported for Standard Subscriptions  
The copilot summary is also delivered to email even for reports that are delivered to OneDrive or SharePoint.

# Licensing Requirements

- The report must be in a Copilot eligible (Add link to the licensing requirements) capacity
- (Add link to subscriptions licensing requirements) 
- Your administrator needs to enable the tenant switch before you start using Copilot. See the article Copilot tenant settings for details.
- Your F64 or P1 capacity needs to be in one of the regions listed in this article, Fabric region availability. If it isn't, you can't use Copilot.
