# Stay on top of your metrics

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Metrics in Power BI let your customers curate their metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. In addition to seeing all your metrics in one view, scorecards make it easy for you to dig deeper into the data, update your metrics, make notes on important events. These features are covered in this article. You can also [follow your goals](service-goals-follow.md), to be notified when they change.

## View metric details 

The metrics Details pane provides the entire history for the metric from the start date, including check-ins, status changes, and relevant notes. 

- To access the details pane, open a scorecard and select the metric name. Power BI automatically shows the details pane.

## Filtering and keyword search 

You can filter scorecards to metrics labeled as a particular status. Selecting the summary cards at the top of the scorecard makes it easy to see what is on track or at risk. 

This metric is _at risk_.

This metric is _behind_.

There's also a keyword search that filters the scorecard down to metrics that match the keyword.  Select the **Filter** icon above the first metric and type the keywords you're looking for.  The scorecard filters to show those results, without losing the context of any parent/child metric relationships, making it easy to quickly find a particular metric and see how it's doing.
