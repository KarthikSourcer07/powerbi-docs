# Customize buttons in Power BI reports

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Whether you create a button in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service, you can customize it in many different ways to suit your requirements. For example, you can turn **Button Text** on or off, and you can change the button shape, icon, fill, title, or the action that happens when users select the button in a report, among other properties.

> [!NOTE]
> Customizing a button requires edit permissions to the report. Sharing a report requires a Power BI Pro or PPU license or for the report to be saved in Premium capacity. For more information, see [Which license do I have](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) and [What is Premium](../enterprise/service-premium-what-is.md).

## Change the shape

A rectangle is the default shape for buttons, but you can change the shape:

1. Select the button you want to change.

1. Navigate to the **Shape** tab of the **Format button** pane, and customize the button to any of these shapes:

   - Arrow
   - Chevron arrow
   - Pentagon arrow
   - Heart
   - Hexagon
   - Isosceles triangle
   - Octagon
   - Oval
   - Parallelogram
   - Pentagon
   - Pill
   - Rectangle
   - Right triangle
   - Rounded rectangle
   - Speech bubble
   - Snipped tab, top right
   - Snipped tab, both top
   - Rounded tab, top right
   - Rounded tab, both top
   - Trapezoid

## Add a custom image or icon

Another great way to customize your button is to add a custom image or icon for your button.

Here’s an example of a button with a custom image:

To add a custom image or icon:

1. Select the button, and navigate to the **Style** > **Icon** tab of the **Format button** pane.

1. Select the **Custom** option for **Icon**, then select **Browse**.

1. After you add your image, you can customize the **Image fit** and **Icon placement**. With icon placement, you can place the image either **Left of text**, **Right of text**, **Below text**, or **Above text**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-customize-button/power-bi-icon-placement-illustration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the icon placement options.":::

1. You can choose the **Custom** option to control the icon’s **Vertical alignment** and **Horizontal alignment**.

1. You can also customize the **Icon size**. By default, the icon size is set to **Auto**, meaning that as you resize the button, the icon size automatically changes size. You can set a fixed **Icon size** (in pixels) by typing a number in the **Icon size** box.

## Add effects

Just like Power BI built-in shapes, Power BI buttons can have artistic effects to suit your design needs:

- **Shape shadow** effects
- **Shape glow** effects
- Button **Shape rotation** and **Text rotation**
