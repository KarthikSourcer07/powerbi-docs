# Arrange columns, metrics, and scorecards

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

In some scenarios, you can hide a column, or put the columns in a different order. You can also want to reorder the metrics in a scorecard, make one metric a submetric of another, or move or copy the entire scorecard to another workspace. As a scorecard author, you can make these changes, moving metrics and scorecards, deciding the columns that your scorecard consumers see, and the order they're in, to optimize the scorecard for your audience.

## Reorder the metrics in a scorecard

It's easy to reorder metrics on the scorecard, or make them submetrics.

- Select a metric and drag it up or down. Indent it slightly to make it a submetric of another metric.

  When you make it a submetric, it takes the color of the metric it's under.

## Hide or move a column

1. Open the scorecard in edit mode, and select the arrow icon next to the column you want to hide or move > **Column settings**.
1. Select **Move right**, **Move left**, or **Hide this column**.

1. You can also re-order columns in this view by dragging them up or down.
1. Select **Apply**.

## Move or copy a scorecard

Many organizations have 'template' scorecards that different departments or business groups might want to use as a starting point; Or you might want to develop a ‘test’ scorecard in My workspace to make sure the metrics are working correctly before moving it to the correct workspace when it’s ready to share. You can now do all this using the move or copy scorecard functionality. The copy scorecard capability is also useful in getting started quickly if you want to create a new scorecard by reusing the metric definition from an existing scorecard.

1. On the **File** menu, select **Move scorecard** or **Copy scorecard**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-goals-move/power-bi-goals-move-copy-scorecard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of move and copy scorecard options in File menu.":::

2. You see a dropdown list of workspaces you have access to. Select the workspace you’d like to move or copy the scorecard to > **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-goals-move/power-bi-goals-move-scorecard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of move scorecard dialog":::

    When you copy a scorecard, you have the option to include or exclude check-in history. This makes it easy to reuse the same scorecard for a newer time period (for example, for fiscal year scorecards) so you don't have to do this all over again.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-goals-move/power-bi-goals-copy-scorecard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of copy the scorecard dialog.":::

 You’ll get a notice when the move or copy operation is complete. It can take a few seconds. Select **Open Scorecard** to open the scorecard in the selected workspace.
