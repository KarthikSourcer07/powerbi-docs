# Overview of Copilot for Power BI (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Copilot for Microsoft Fabric Public Preview is available in Power BI. Copilot helps you use the transformational power of generative AI to get the most from your data. This article provides an overview of the Copilot capabilities for Power BI.

Before your business can start using Copilot capabilities in Power BI, your administrator needs to [enable Copilot in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview#enable-copilot).

[!INCLUDE [copilot-notes](../includes/copilot-notes.md)]

## Get started with report creation

Power BI has introduced generative AI that allows you to create reports automatically by selecting the topic for a report or by prompting Copilot on a particular topic, and create a narrative visual that generates a summary of your report using generative AI. The following sections cover the details of the features and how to use Copilot.

## Feature overview: Copilot capabilities

You can interact with Copilot in several different ways in Power BI. The main and most obvious way is to open the Copilot pane and ask Copilot to create a report page, or a summary of a page. 

Copilot can also create a narrative visual that summarizes a page or a whole report. 

And Copilot can generate synonyms for Q&A, to help your report readers find what they're looking for in your reports.

Here are four examples of what Copilot can generate.

- A [report outline of suggested pages](#a-report-outline-of-suggested-pages)
- A [narrative visual](#a-narrative-visual)
- A [summary response about your report content](#a-summary-response-about-your-report-content)
- [Descriptions for your semantic model measures](#descriptions-for-semantic-model-measures)

### A report outline of suggested pages

Copilot can provide a summary of your dataset and an outline of suggested pages for your report. Copilot creates a starting point. It might not be perfect, and it might not be exactly what you had in mind. But once you have the starting point, you can modify it from there to be exactly what you want.

- A [report outline of suggested pages for your report](copilot-create-report.md): for example, what each page in the report will be about, and how many pages it will create.  
- The visuals for the individual pages.

### A narrative visual

With Copilot, you can create a visual that generates a text summary of the data visualized in your report canvas.  The visual offers suggested prompts, and a space that allows you to direct the summary for your specific needs, offering an easy to read, useful guide for the end user. The summary updates in keeping with slicers and filters, and as the data refreshes. 

Learn more [narrative visuals](copilot-create-narrative.md).

### A summary response about your report content

Even if you don't have edit permission for a report, with Copilot you can generate a summary of a report page in the Copilot pane. You have the flexibility to refine or guide the summary by customizing prompts, such as "summarize this page using bullet points" or "Provide a summary of sales on this page." 
 
You can also pose specific questions about the visualized data on a report page and receive a tailored response. This response includes references to specific visuals, aiding you in understanding the specific data sources contributing to each part of the answer or summary within the report.

### Synonyms to enhance Q&A

Copilot can write [synonyms that you can add to Q&A](../natural-language/q-and-a-copilot-enhancements.md) to improve the Q&A visual's ability to understand user questions.

:::image type="content" source="media/copilot-introduction/q-and-a-copilot-suggestions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Copilot can add suggestions for synonyms.":::

### Descriptions for semantic model measures

Copilot can add descriptions to your semantic model measures. People building reports from your semantic model can see the name and description of your measures, making the description property essential documentation.
