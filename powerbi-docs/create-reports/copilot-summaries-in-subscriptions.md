# Create reports subscriptions with Copilot summaries in the Power BI service 

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You can include a Copilot generated summary for your Power BI report page or full report attachment in your email subscription to get insights. All the recipients of the email subscription receive the copilot summary in the email. This feature is currently supported only for Standard Subscriptions.  
The copilot summary is delivered in the email even for reports that are delivered to OneDrive or SharePoint.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Copilot summaries for email subscriptions aren't supported for paginated reports, scrorecards, and dashboards.
- The Copilot summary is run on behalf of the subscription owner, much like email subscriptions.
- User-defined prompts aren't supported.
