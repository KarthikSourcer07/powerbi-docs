# Create reports subscriptions with Copilot summaries in the Power BI service 

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You can include a Copilot generated summary for your Power BI report page or full report attachment in your email subscription to get insights. All the recipients of the email subscription will receive the copilot summary in the email. This feature is currently supported for Standard Subscriptions  
The copilot summary is also delivered to email even for reports that are delivered to OneDrive or SharePoint.

## Licensing Requirements

- Ensure you have reviewed [what's required to get copilot to work in Power BI](copilot-enable-power-bi.md)
- [Subscription Requirements](../collaborate-share/end-user-subscribe.md#requirements)

- The Copilot summary is run on behalf of the subscription owner, much like email subscriptions.
- User-defined prompts are not supported.
